# Contributing to Notification Service

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Notification Service as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Requests

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the documentation with details of any API changes
3. The PR should work for Node.js 12.x and above
4. Ensure all tests pass

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the MIT Software License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write Bug Reports with Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
